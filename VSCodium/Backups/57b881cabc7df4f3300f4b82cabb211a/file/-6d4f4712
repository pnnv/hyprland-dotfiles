Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Google Internship program, particularly for positions that leverage my skills in problem-solving and competitive programming. As a 3rd at National Institute of Technology Raipur with a strong academic background and a drive to innovate, I am confident that I can be a valuable asset to your team.

Beyond academics, my passion for problem-solving fuels my participation in competitive programming. This experience has honed my analytical skills, logical thinking, and ability to develop efficient algorithms.  I am proficient in C++, Python, and Java, and enjoy tackling complex challenges in a competitive environment.

I am particularly interested in Software Development and cyber security. I believe my technical background, problem-solving skills, and eagerness to learn make me a perfect fit for a Google internship.

I have attached my resume for your review, which further details my qualifications. Thank you for your time and consideration. I am eager to learn more about the internship program and how I can contribute to Google's innovative culture.

Sincerely,

Prahlad Khairnar
